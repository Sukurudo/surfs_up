# Module 9 Challenge.
# Surf's Up Data Comparison.
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he feels there is one piece of information missing: seasonal data. Heâ€™s asked you to gather data on the seasons of Oahu and determine whether the seasons could affect the surf and ice cream shop business. Specifically, are there certain times of the year when business might be slower, or the type of customer could be different?

## Oahu Data for June and December (between Jan 1, 2010 and Aug 23, 2017 )

## June Measurements

|  | Precipitation | Temperature |
|---|---|---|
Mean| 0.13 | 74.9 |
Min | 0.00 | 64.0 |
Max | 4.43 | 85.0 |

## December Measurements


|  | Precipitation | Temperature |
|---|---|---|
Mean| 0.21 | 71.0 |
Min | 0.00 | 56.0 |
Max | 6.42 | 83.0 |

# Analysis

The mean temperature between June (summer) and December (winter) is just 3 degrees. This implies that Oahu has a warm average age temperature year round. Warm weather means more ice-cream. While the lowest temperatures in December are 56, the mean precipitation is just .21 inches; it will be pretty dry most of the time, which allows for good ice-cream and surfing weather. Oahu is a rainforest, so some rain is always expected- the difference between maximum rain between June and December is 2 inches. However both moths have a small mean, which means there will be days of high rainfall, followed by many days of little to no rain.

Overall Oahu is an excellent for a surf and ice-cream shop. The warm average temperatures will keep customers coming, and the low rain fall will ensure there are many beach days ahead.

## Further analysis

- I recommend we look at average rainfall on an hour by hour basis for the same months to determine how long rainfall could last. Is the rainfall all day? Or just part of the day- would there be days of no beach, or would it just affect part of the business day?

- How do the other islands in Hawai'i compare to Oahu? Do the results match in Maui? Could we expand operations to the other locations?

- Tourism vs Local population: We should see if data is available on what the tourist and local population is like during the year, should we focus on local flavor- or aim towards the tourist population?
